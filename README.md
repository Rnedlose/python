Personal Python Projects

I am self-learning Python.  These are some of the projects that I've worked on to learn
how to code in Python.

*Daily Sales*
This was written after my very first programming class, and I used the pseudocode and flow
charts I wrote in that class to make this little program.  It is my very first program.

*Guessing Game*
This is a basic number guessing game.  I wrote this to test out my knowledge of Python.

*Setup Script*
After learning some Python, I came across proper folder/file structure, and I am working on
learning how to write some scripts that will auto-mate the whole process.

*VEnv*
This is my first venture into using virtual environments with Python.  Within it lives my
attempt at an Instagram Bot.  I'm using selenium and instapy.cli to learn more about Python
and some of the tools out there.
